<!-- 	This is an example of the file that the server looks for when starting the UCT IMS IPTV Application Server
     	The key is any text between the SIP: and the @domain that the server recieves in an invite.
	So for example sip:channel1@open-ims.test will be parsed to channel1. 
	
	The value is the rtsp address of the server along with the path of the media file the client is requesting.
